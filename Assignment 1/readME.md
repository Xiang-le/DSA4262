## Assignment 1
### Assignment details
Students are required to select at least two mental health data sources, and generate three distinct visualisations. Each visualisation must serve a progressive narrative purpose:

Plot 1: the Macro plot that established the landscape of our topic of interest. This should establish why this is an interesting and important topic to work on. For example, this visualisation can show who is affected by a certain condition.

Plot 2: the Micro (deep dive) plot that reveals a certain nuance in the data. For example, this would illustrate why or how something is happening.

Plot 3: the Actionable plot defines a clear target for intervention. It should motivate and communicate where and how a resource can be deployed effectively. For example, it can show in what neighbourhood your intervention should be deployed.
